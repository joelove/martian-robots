# Martian Robots

##### A lightweight CLI to control a martian robot hoarde, built using Node.js and TypeScript.

---

### Prerequisites

This command line tool relies on [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). If you're running MacOS, you should have this pre-installed and be ready to go. If you have any trouble, take a look at [the Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Installation

The CLI uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to handle dependencies. To install everything we need, use:

```shell
npm install
```

One that's out of the way, you can run the CLI with:

```shell
npm start
```

### Testing

This CLI is tested using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). You can run the tests using:

```shell
npm run test
```

### Development

To make life easier, this CLI has a development server which will hot reload your changes when you change files. To run it, just use:

```shell
npm run dev
```

During development, you may also want the tests to run automatically (for some good old red-green refactoring!). You guessed it:

```shell
npm run test:watch
```
